# Introduction to Python
In this course I will learn the basics of OOP programming.

## First Step
In the first **step** I will _learn_ how to create a new class in Python. To create a class, write the following Python code.
```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name):
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name

std = Student("Sari", "Naif")

```
