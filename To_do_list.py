# Project: To-Do List Application
# The goal of this project is to create a simple application that helps the user manage their to-do list. The application should have the following features:
# 1. Task input: The user should be able to enter the tasks they need to complete.done
# 2. Task display: The user should be able to view a list of all the tasks they have entered.done
# 3. Task completion: The user should be able to mark a task as complete.
# 4. Task deletion: The user should be able to delete a task from the list.
# 5. Task prioritization: The user should be able to assign a priority level (high, medium, low) to each task, and the tasks should be displayed in order of priority.
# 6. Saving and loading data: The application should save the data entered by the user to a file, so that it can be loaded later.
# To fulfill these requirements, you will need to use the following Python concepts and features:
# * Variables and data types (e.g. integers, strings, lists)
# * Input and output (e.g. using the input function and printing results)
# * Control structures (e.g. if statements, loops)
# * Functions and modules
# * File input/output (e.g. using the open and write functions)
# * Data structures (e.g. lists,Â dictionaries)
